## Overview

A very short, maybe three sentence summary of what this proposal is about. A high level "overview" or "what this adds".

## Background

Melee combat is easily called shallow with ALL weapons and creatures resorting to a "WIDESWING WIDESWING WIDESWING WIDESWING WIDESWING WIDESWING" spam to kill. 
specifically, people lack nearly all agency in *intentional* and fast paced attacks the moment you try to move away from this. There is no dedicated button to melee
so there is a massive lack of retail space on the keyboard to realistically use for any expansion. But expansion for any more depth is necessary as for a creature like
Ninja their quick bar becomes to over crowded, overwelming, and complicated. you can only realistically hit, in a fast paced fight, or any kind of panic, numbers one
through six or seven. So within the current set up setting up 8 more quick abilities for expanded melee combat would unecessarly bloat the game. 

Though, to narrow down the exact issue that needs addressing, in an example as follows: "a syndicate with no slips, and an emp implant swings a wrench at an engi without a suit.
the engi only has what he can realistically hang onto" so long as the syndi even has so much as a knife, the only solution is to run, which feels like shit since often they DONT
have a knife, infact they have a sword. What happens is even experienced players quickly realise that anyone half baked and prepared leaves you with literally no option but to run
feeling helpless. your only agency over your own life is to simply hope by some blind luck you live.

A Melee combat system, a way to realistically have a fight where someone, with sufficient skill, but due to luck, not always have the situation, be able to disarm, parry, or expand
their list of abilities to survive these situations. Also because I feel like shit when im forced into a situation where though I WANT to fight I am FORCED to run. Also it kinda REALLY 
it rubs salt in the wound that as Ninja or Captain/Mime with my trusty baguette I cant properly duel someone, with proper blocks, deflects, stabs, and slashes. 


Summarize any information that is needed to contextualize the proposed changes, e.g. the current state of the game.

Also link any relevant discussions on Discord, GitHub, or HackMD that are relevant to the proposal.

## The rest?

Placeholder: ive still got other stuff in life so give me grace as I fumble through this.
